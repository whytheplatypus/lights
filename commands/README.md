#Notes

##Todos

- [ ] same as before why 0? should be something like GetKeyboard


- [ ] what does this mean that it's the first device?


- [ ] why set it back to this? what's going on here?


- [ ] better for this to be a named function so it's clear what's happening


- [ ] this should be the first thing that happens


- [ ] named function to be clear we're making a fifo


- [ ] can we not use these?


- [ ] I've seen ths before, that's no good


- [ ] encapsulate to be clear we're getting a keyboard


- [ ] what if there's no keyboard


- [ ] what is this? a render loop?


- [ ] these 3 or 4 statements feel jumbled


- [ ] this is a parser/unmarshler, whtever


- [ ] it's rendering into s and sending s to a pipe, this should be made clear via
code and function names


- [ ] return don't panic
